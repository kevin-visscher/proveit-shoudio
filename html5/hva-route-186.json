For those who would like to experience a cross section of the history of Amsterdam. En route you will find surprising shops, bars and restaurants.\r\n\r\nThe audio guide starts on the Dam square. You could opt to walk the route, although we advise you to cycle. There are plenty of bicycle rental spots close by.\r\n\r\nBe advised: Cycling in Amsterdam is an interesting challenge! So watch out for tramrails, cabs and certainly for other cyclists!\r\n\r\nPlease note that this route is 30 MB to download.

The residential count in the year 1500 was a mere 30.000.\n\nFrom its humble beginnings, the dam has always served as the centre of the city and trade activity. It was were the ships docked and fish was traded. In this era, the 'IJ' was still a wild and salt water river. The city had a briny (salty) smell and sea gulls would be roaming the skies all over. Only a very strong seawall would ensure the safety of its residents.\n\nOn the dam, the first town hall was constructed, later replaced by the enormous city hall built in the Golden age. The building aimed to symbolize the wealth and power of the citizens. It is built on 13659 poles.\n\n<i>\nLook towards city hall and walk in to the street to the right of it.

As an urban engineer Van Eesteren wanted a clear separation between living, working, traffic and recreation, the neighborhood would be one of light, air and space. A luxury that should also be available for the working class. The first apartment buildings with strokes of green between them rose to the sky.\n\nBos en Lommer was an urban experiment, the first of its kind in Amsterdam and in the world where the working class could enjoy such principals.\n\n<i>Cycle ahead on the Bos en Lommerweg and traverse the large crossing with the Admiraal de Ruyterweg. After about a hundred meters you will find a white building to your left, this used to be a reformed church, designed by architect Boeyinga in 1951. Now it is in use as a theatre called Podium Mozaiek and it boasts a restaurant and bar. Because of the way the lights from within this building would flood on to the street at night it is nicknamed 'the tea light' or 't Theelichtje'.<\/i>","duration":"0.000","nearby":"Bos en Lommerweg 477-495, 1055 Amsterdam, The Netherlands","hasmp3":"1","hasimg":"1","client_id":"shoudiomaker","license_id":"7","attribution":null,"type":"shoudio","poi_address":"","poi_zip":"","poi_state":"","poi_city":"","poi_country":"","poi_category":"1","email":"","telephone":"","external_link":"","mission_question":"","mission_answertype":"none","list_id":"12806","shoudio_id":"6539","collections_id":"186","sorting":"16","u_id":"2490","u_name":"amsterdamwest","u_img":"jpg"},{"id":"6540","uid":"2490","deviceid":"0","iplong":"1441996323","created_at":"2013-03-31 16:46:00","lat":"52.3801693616","lon":"4.8538863995","published":"1","speed":"0","altitude":"0","heading":"0","locationAccuracy":"0","altitudeAccuracy":"0","locationTimestamp":"1364748360","placeid":"0","channelid":"0","message":"Worker flats","description":"At your right you will see worker flats that were developed after the second world was.
