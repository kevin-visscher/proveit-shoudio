The present bridge was built in 19 thirtyfour. The first bridge at this site was built in 16 ninetyone as Kerkstraatbrug and had 13 arches. Because this bridge was very narrow, the locals called it magere brug, which literally means \"skinny bridge\". In 1871 the state of the bridge was so bad that it was demolished and replaced by a nine-arched wooden bridge. <br \/>\n<br \/>\nFifty years later this bridge also needed to be replaced. Architect Piet Kramer made several designs for a steel and stone bridge, but the city decided to replace it with a new bridge that looked the same as the previous, only slightly bigger. In 1934 the bridge was demolished and replaced. The last major renovation was in 1969. Until 1994 the bridge was opened by hand, but now is opened automatically.<br \/>\nUse of the bridge has been limited to pedestrians and cyclists since 2003. It is however opened many times a day in order to let through river traffic. The boats used for sightseeing tours are low enough to pass underneath the bridge when closed. The bridge is decorated with 1200 light bulbs that are turned on in the evening.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nA story told to tourists about the origins of the 1691 version of the bridge is that it was built by two wealthy sisters who lived on opposite sides of the Amstel river and wanted to be able to visit one another every day (and were presumably too busy, or not in good enough health, to go the long way round via another bridge, of which there must surely have been at least one). In one variant of the story the sisters, although wealthy, were not quite wealthy enough to afford a bridge of adequate width for general use and so built a very narrow bridge, hence its name. In another variant of the story the sisters' last name was Mager, hence the bridge's name (rather than from its narrowness).<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe bridge can be seen in a number of films, such as the James Bond film Diamonds Are Forever from 1971.","duration":"176.398","nearby":"Magere Brug, Amsterdam, The Netherlands","hasmp3":"1","hasimg":"1","client_id":"iphone","license_id":"7","attribution":null,"type":"shoudio","poi_address":null,"poi_zip":null,"poi_state":null,"poi_city":null,"poi_country":null,"poi_category":null,"email":null,"telephone":null,"external_link":"","mission_question":null,"mission_answertype":"none","list_id":"11769","shoudio_id":"883","collections_id":"7","sorting":"-1","u_id":"1","u_name":"roelandp","u_img":"jpg"},{"id":"882","uid":"1","deviceid":"0","iplong":"1600212490","created_at":"2011-04-27 14:29:13","lat":"52.3731040000","lon":"4.8913730000","published":"1","speed":"0","altitude":"0","heading":"0","locationAccuracy":"0","altitudeAccuracy":"0","locationTimestamp":"1303914201","placeid":"97","channelid":"146","message":"Royal Palace on the Damsquare","description":"When the Royal Palace was built in the 17th Century, the Netherlands was a republic so the building was actually Amsterdam\u2019s city hall.  The building became the royal palace of king Louis Napoleon and later of the Dutch Royal House. The building is very extravagant for a city hall because the 17th Century was Amsterdam\u2019s Golden Age.  The city made a fortune with the Dutch East Indies Company, which sailed around the world moving goods and people. <br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe town hall was opened on July twentieth 1655 by Cornelis de Graeff, the political and social leader of Amsterdam. It was built by Jacob van Campen. He took control of the construction project in 1648, as the Town Hall for the City of Amsterdam. It was built on 13,659 wooden piles. <br \/>\n<br \/>\nA yellowish sandstone from Bentheim in Germany was used for the entire building. Marble was the chosen material for the interior.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nJacob van Campen was inspired by Roman palaces. He drew inspiration from the public buildings of Rome. He wanted to build a new capitol for the Amsterdam burgomasters who thought of themselves as the consuls of the new Rome of the North. The technical implementation was looked after by the town construction master Dani\u00ebl Stalpaert. <br \/>\n<br \/>\nAfter three and a half years of extensive interior renovations to the Royal Palace, the Palace opened its doors for public again in 2009. The result of this renovation is a historical treasure that features the best of its 17th and 19th century splendor. <br \/>\n<br \/>\nNowadays the palace is used by Queen Beatrix for entertaining and official functions during state visits and other official receptions, such as the Queen's New Year receptions and several award ceromonies.

The latter was completed in 1885, strategically located near to waterways, the rail network and access roads. Originally, the gas was used for street lighting.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe director, Julius Pazzani (1841\u20131888), assumed responsibility for the technicalities of the manufacturing process and for the site itself. The building designs were commissioned from the Amsterdam-based architect Isaac Gosschalk (1838\u20131907). Gosschalk worked in the picturesque Dutch Neo-Renaissance style he initiated.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nIn 1898, Amsterdam\u2019s city council took over the running of the factory. Production increased and the site was expanded. Later, gas production was gradually reduced as the city council started sourcing more and more of its gas from Hoogovens in IJmuiden and, from 1963, natural gas from Slochteren. The Westergasfabriek ceased gas production gas in 1967.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nBy the time the factory shut down, the site was heavily polluted, making it difficult to find a new purpose for the area. In the meantime the GEB, the municipal energy company, used it for storage and as a workshop. From 1992, the buildings were used temporarily for creative and cultural activities. Adventurous entrepreneurs and artists flocked to the site.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nIt was immediately clear that Westergasfabriek was the ideal location for events such as De Kunstvlaai art fair, the Holland Festival and Awakenings techno parties. It became the meeting place of choice for creative and innovative Amsterdam residents. The site and the creative buzz around it ultimately led to the area becoming a permanently designated cultural zone.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nNow, the Westergasfabriek is providing a new surge of energy and light. The redeveloped factory site and the beautifully laid out park are an asset for the local area. Creative entrepreneurs work in the renovated historic buildings and many high-profile events and festivals are held here. The Westergasfabriek is regarded as a model for redevelopment, far beyond the Netherlands\u2019 borders.

Throughout the 16th-century battles, the church was looted and defaced on numerous occasions, first in the Beeldenstorm of 1566, when most of the church art and fittings were destroyed by a mob, including an altarpiece with a central panel by Jan van Scorel and side panels painted on both sides by Maarten van Heemskerck. All that was spared were the paintings on the ceiling that could not be reached.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nLocals would gather in the church to gossip, peddlers sold their goods and beggars sought shelter. This was not tolerated by the Calvinists and the homeless were expelled. In 1681 the choir was closed off with a brass screen. Above the screen is the text, \u201cThe false practices gradually introduced into God\u2019s church, were here undone again in the year seventy eight,\u201d referring to the Reformation in 15 seventyeight.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nIn the same year, the Oude Kerk became home to the registry of marriages. It was also used as the city archives, the most important documents locked in a chest covered with iron plates and painted with the city\u2019s coat of arms. The chest was kept safe in the iron chapel.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nRembrandt was a frequent visitor to the Oude Kerk and his children were all christened here. It is the only building in Amsterdam that remains in its original state since Rembrandt walked its halls. In the Holy Sepulchre is a small Rembrandt exhibition, a shrine to his wife \u201cSaskia\u201d van Uylenburgh who was buried here in 1782.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe church covers an area of some 3,300 square meters. The foundations were set on an artificial mound, thought to be the most solid ground of the settlement in this marshy province.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe roof of the Oude Kerk is the largest medieval wooden vault in Europe. The Estonian planks date back to 1390 and boast some of the best acoustics in Europe. Many concerts are performed here.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe floor consists entirely of gravestones. The reason for this is that the church was built on a cemetery. Local citizens continued to be buried on the site within the confines of the church until 1865. There are 2500 graves in the Oude Kerk, under which are buried 10,000 Amsterdam citizens<br \/>\n<br \/>\nToday the Oude Kerk is a centre for both religious and cultural activities and can be rented for presentations, receptions and dinner parties. Among the events hosted is the prestigious annual World Press Photo awards ceremony.","duration":"259.078","nearby":"Oudekerksplein 23, 1012 Amsterdam, The Netherlands","hasmp3":"1","hasimg":"1","client_id":"iphone","license_id":"7","attribution":null,"type":"shoudio","poi_address":null,"poi_zip":null,"poi_state":null,"poi_city":null,"poi_country":null,"poi_category":null,"email":null,"telephone":null,"external_link":"","mission_question":null,"mission_answertype":"none","list_id":"11776","shoudio_id":"878","collections_id":"7","sorting":"3","u_id":"1","u_name":"roelandp","u_img":"jpg"},{"id":"880","uid":"1","deviceid":"0","iplong":"1600212490","created_at":"2011-04-27 14:27:19","lat":"52.3733300000","lon":"4.8979500000","published":"1","speed":"0","altitude":"0","heading":"0","locationAccuracy":"0","altitudeAccuracy":"0","locationTimestamp":"1303913939","placeid":"97","channelid":"146","message":"Red Light District De Wallen","description":"De Wallen is the largest and best-known red-light district in Amsterdam and a major tourist attraction.

Since 1988 The Felix Meritis Foundation has been located in the building as a European centre for art, culture and science.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe society Felix Meritis was established by the middle classes of Amsterdam in 1777. On October 31, 1788, the building of the same name opened its doors. The society, inspired by the Enlightenment ideals, focused on the promotion of arts and sciences and distinguished several departments: Music, Drawing Studies, Physics, Commerce and Literature. Felix Meritis\u2019 oval concert hall was the main music hall in Amsterdam until late into the 19th century and enjoyed a great international reputation. Many famous musicians performed there, including Robert and Clara Schumann, Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns, Johannes Brahms and Julius R\u00f6ntgen. The orchestra of Felix Meritis was regarded as the best of the Netherlands and accompanied many Dutch premieres, directed by conductors such as Johannes Bernardus van Bree. Thus, Beethoven\u2019s Ninth Symphony and Berlioz\u2019s Symphonie fantastique were first played in the concert hall of Felix Meritis. The small hall of the Concertgebouw is a replica of this concert hall. The society was abolished in 1888.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe society commissioned Jacob Otten Husly (1738\u20131796) to design the building in Louis XVI style. This style refers to Classicism, which is characteristic of the Age of Enlightenment. The classical temple fa\u00e7ade with its colossal Corinthian pilasters and pediment is characteristic of the neoclassical style. The society's departments - visual arts and architecture, literature, trade, natural sciences and music - are symbolized in five embossed sculptures. The interior includes original 18th-century features such as the central staircase, the oval concert hall (renowned for its acoustics) and the domed roof - underneath which there used to be an observatory. The building is a national monument.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nWhen the society was dissolved in 1888 the printing company Holdert &amp; Co., which became one of Amsterdam's largest printing companies, took it over. In 1932 part of the building was destroyed in a fire. After the Second World War the Communist Party of the Netherlands set up its headquarters in the building. From 1947 until 1981 the newspaper 'The Truth' ('De Waarheid') rolled from the presses. In the 50\u2019s Felix Meritis was the symbol of communism in the Netherlands. This image has been embedded in the collective memory since the storming of the building on November 4, 1956, in response to the Russian invasion of Hungary. In the late sixties Felix Meritis became the cradle of evenings for alternative youth, which were named Provadya. In 1969 the Shaffy Theater opened, which gained a reputation as a stopping place for the Dutch avant-garde including Ramses Shaffy, Baal, Holland's Hope, Independent Theater and Hauser Orkater. In 1988 The Felix Meritis foundation was established in the building as a European center for art, culture and science.","duration":"261.904","nearby":"Keizersgracht 254, 1016 Amsterdam, The Netherlands","hasmp3":"1","hasimg":"1","client_id":"iphone","license_id":"7","attribution":null,"type":"shoudio","poi_address":null,"poi_zip":null,"poi_state":null,"poi_city":null,"poi_country":null,"poi_category":null,"email":null,"telephone":null,"external_link":"","mission_question":null,"mission_answertype":"none","list_id":"11779","shoudio_id":"874","collections_id":"7","sorting":"6","u_id":"1","u_name":"roelandp","u_img":"jpg"},{"id":"873","uid":"1","deviceid":"0","iplong":"1600212490","created_at":"2011-04-27 13:54:50","lat":"52.3727890000","lon":"4.8935620000","published":"1","speed":"0","altitude":"0","heading":"0","locationAccuracy":"0","altitudeAccuracy":"0","locationTimestamp":"1303912168","placeid":"97","channelid":"146","message":"The Dam (National Monument)","description":"Dam Square, or \u2018The Dam\u2019, derives its name from its original function: a dam on the Amstel River, hence also the name of the city. Built in approximately 1270, the dam formed the first connection between the settlements on the sides of the river.<br \/>\nAs the dam was gradually built up it became wide enough for a town square, which remained the core of the town developing around it. Dam Square as it exists today grew out of what was originally two squares: the actual dam, called Middeldam; and Plaetse, on the westside. A large fish market arose where ships moored at the dam to load and unload goods. The area became a center not only of commercial activity but also of the government, as the site of Amsterdam's town hall.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nAs a market square, the Dam had a weigh house that can be seen in some old paintings. It was demolished in 1808 by order of Louis Bonaparte who, upon taking up residence in the newly converted Royal Palace, complained that his view was obstructed.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThe Damrak, or the former mouth of the Amstel River, was partially filled in the 19th century; since then, the Dam square has been surrounded by land on all sides. The new land made room for the Beurs van Zocher, a stock exchange that was built in 1837. After the stock trade moved to the Beurs van Berlage in 1903, the Zocher building was demolished. In its place, De Bijenkorf department store has stood since 1914.<br \/>\n<br \/>\nIn the time of the horse tram at the end of the 19th century the Dam was the most important tram hub of Amsterdam.
